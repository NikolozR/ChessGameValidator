# Chess PGN Validator

This project is a Java-based PGN (Portable Game Notation) validator that parses and validates chess games from `.pgn`
files. It simulates the moves on an internal board model, checking syntax and legality based on standard chess rules.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ board/              # ChessBoard and ChessBoardSquare classes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pieces/             # Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, ChessPiece and ChessPieceI (Interface)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ game/               # GameColor and general utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ io/                 # PGNReader, Tokenizer, ChessValidator and test cases
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/              # JUnit tests for each piece
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/                    # Compiled classes
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### 1. `PGNReader`

Reads the `.pgn` file and extracts the relevant part of the game (i.e., the actual moves and game information).

### 2. `Tokenizer`

Breaks the PGN string into individual move tokens.

During this phase, **syntactic validation** is performed using regex:

```java
public static final Pattern LEGAL_CHESS_MOVE =
        Pattern.compile("^((O-O(-O)?)|([KQRBN][a-h]?[1-8]?x?[a-h][1-8])|([a-h][1-8](=[QRBN])?)|([a-h]x[a-h][1-8](=[QRBN])?)|)(\\+|#)?$");
```

Only moves matching this pattern are allowed to proceed to the next phase.

### 3. `Chess Simulation`

Each move is simulated on an internal `ChessBoard` using custom logic and classes for each piece. Invalid moves (e.g.,
illegal knight move, moving into check) are caught and flagged.

## Running the Project

#### Command To Compile Code

```bash
javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/Main.java
```

#### Command to run with your .pgn file

```cmd
java -cp bin Main /your/path/of/pgnFile.pgn
```

This will:

1. Compile all necessary classes.
2. Launch the simulation via `Main.java`.
3. Don't worry if you don't have .pgn file, run this command and default .pgn will be tested

```cmd
java -cp bin Main
```

## âœ… Features

- PGN format parsing and regex-based syntax validation
- Full chessboard model with piece movement logic
- Legal move simulation (including captures, castling, promotion, en passant)
- Clear feedback on invalid or illegal moves

---

## ðŸ§ª Unit Testing

Each chess piece is tested using JUnit with comprehensive test cases:

- Movement rules (valid and invalid)
- Blocking and capturing
- Initial moves (e.g., pawn double move)

Tests are located under `tests/` directory.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Castling, promotion, and en passant rules are respected.
